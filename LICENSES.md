# Piper App – License Information

## Overview

Piper is an iOS/macOS speech synthesis application, architected to separate GPLv3 and MIT code. This project contains **two independent modules**:

1. **Audio Unit Extension** – GPLv3 Licensed
2. **Main Application (UI Frontend)** – MIT Licensed

The modules communicate only via **XPC**, never link GPL libraries directly into the MIT app. This ensures GPLv3 compliance while keeping the main app under the permissive MIT license.

## 1. Audio Unit Extension (GPLv3)

The Audio Unit Extension links with the following **GPLv3 libraries**:

- [eSpeak-NG SPM](https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng-spm) – GNU General Public License v3, 29 June 2007
- [Piper GPL](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) – GNU General Public License v3, 29 June 2007

All code in the Audio Unit Extension, including any modifications to the above libraries, is licensed under **GPLv3**. The extension is a **standalone program** and may be distributed independently or as a plugin, provided GPLv3 requirements are met.

**Key points under GPLv3:**

- You may use, modify, and redistribute this module under GPLv3.
- Source code must remain available when distributing the Extension or derivatives.
- The Extension **cannot be sublicensed under proprietary terms**.

## 2. Main Application (MIT License)

The main application provides the user interface and communicates with the Audio Unit Extension **only via XPC**, without linking or including any GPLv3 code. This ensures the MIT license can safely apply to the main app.

Therefore, the main application is licensed under the **MIT License**:

## 3. Important Notes

- The **Main Application** and **Audio Unit Extension** are **separate programs**. Communication occurs only via **XPC**, never linking GPL code. Distributing the Extension as a separate binary or plugin ensures GPLv3 obligations remain isolated from the MIT-licensed main app.
- The shared framework contains only original Swift types, constants, Codable structs, and utility code (e.g., Logger) used for XPC communication. It **does not include any GPLv3 code** and may be safely imported into both the MIT main application and the GPLv3 Audio Unit Extension.
- Users and developers must comply with GPLv3 when redistributing the Extension.
- Any modifications to the main application can be licensed freely (MIT or other), while modifications to the Extension remain under GPLv3.
